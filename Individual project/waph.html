<h3> Course Overview : </h3>
<p class="styled-paragraph">This course explores the complexities of hacking and web application development, giving us the tools we need to succeed in both fields. We cover the fundamentals of front-end development, such as HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, as well as back-end development, which uses PHP and MySQL, through a combination of theory and practical experience. Understanding web application architecture and the mutually beneficial interplay between client-side and server-side components is a primary goal. We also explore the topic of web application security, where they use hands-on exercises to find typical weaknesses and threats. The goal of the course is to provide us with the skills necessary to create reliable and secure web applications as well as the knowledge to recognise, stop, and lessen any security risks. By fusing theoretical ideas with practical. Through real-world examples, students learn how to develop and deploy web-based solutions that follow safe programming standards and guidelines. In summary, this course equips students with the necessary skills to effectively navigate the intricate realm of web development and cybersecurity, allowing them to construct robust and secure web applications that adhere to industry standards.

<h3>Individual Project-1 Overview :</h3>
<p class="justified-text">I have to create and launch a professional profile website on GitHub Pages for this project. The website will function as a thorough profile, complete with my name, photo, contact data, educational background, employment experiences, and talents, all of which are included on my resume. To further introduce the "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course and associated practical projects, I'll make a separate page. I'll aim the profile towards potential employers as part of my job application, and I'll use an open-source CSS framework like Bootstrap to provide a polished appearance in order to meet the non-technical standards. In addition, I'll incorporate a page tracker to keep an eye on website traffic and interaction, like Google Analytics or Flag Counter. Technically speaking, I'll implement fundamental JavaScript features like digital and analogue clock, the ability to display and hide emails, and one more feature made possible by jQuery and another JavaScript framework or package. I'll also combine two public Web APIs: Weatherbit and XKCD, which are both graphic-rich, to provide graphical data to the page, and jokeAPI, which will show a new joke every minute. Finally, I'll customise the welcome message using JavaScript cookies, displaying "Welcome to my webpage!" for returning visitors and "Welcome back! For returning visitors, it was [date/time] when you were here last. With this project, I hope to demonstrate my abilities in cloud deployment, JavaScript programming, front-end web development, and API integration.

<h3>Lab -1 Overview </h3>
<p class="styled-paragraph">I learned a number of new ideas and techniques for creating web applications and network protocols. The practical approach was very interesting as it offered valuable insights into the workings of the HTTP protocol, how to use Telnet to send HTTP requests, and how to install CGI applications on a web server. Studying PHP for web development, comprehending security issues, and using Wireshark for protocol analysis gave theoretical knowledge a useful practical component. Ajax and jQuery were introduced, and the usage of technologies like Curl for HTTP POST requests demonstrated the dynamic nature of online application development.</p>

<h3>Lab-2 Overview</h3>
<p class="styled-paragraph">In Lab 2, I developed HTML files including forms and integrated JavaScript to add dynamic functionality, like showing the current date and time, recording keystrokes, and putting in place digital and analogue clocks. This allowed me to go deeper into front-end development. In order to improve the responsiveness and interactivity of web applications, I also investigated the integration of Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and Web APIs. I strengthened my knowledge and expertise in web development by using these abilities in further assignments, such as creating Ajax queries to retrieve data from external APIs and using CSS and jQuery to improve the user experience. All in all, these labs gave me a strong foundation in web application development and gave me the abilities I needed to take on increasingly difficult tasks in the future.

<h3>Hackathon-1 Overview</h3>
<p class="styled-paragraph">Hackathon 1 gave participants a hands-on introduction to web application security while delving into the nuances of cross-site scripting (XSS) threats and defences. In Task 1, participants were given seven levels of reflected XSS difficulties and were tasked with injecting code to cause alerts that showed their names. Every stage demanded strategic exploitation of the echo.php application's weaknesses due to its increasing difficulty. Tests were conducted to see how well participants could recognise and take advantage of XSS vulnerabilities. Extra points were given for correctly recognising source code vulnerabilities. In Task 2, the emphasis moved to defensive tactics, necessitating that participants reinforce susceptible code from earlier experiments. The front-end interface was strengthened against potential XSS attacks by participants through the implementation of input validation and encoding mechanisms. This pragmatic approach deepened understanding by offering priceless insights and practical skills applicable to real-world circumstances.participants' comprehension of web application security and improving their ability to protect websites from harmful vulnerabilities.
