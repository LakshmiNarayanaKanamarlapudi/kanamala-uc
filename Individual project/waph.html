<h3>Lab-1</h3>
<p>I learned a number of new ideas and techniques for creating web applications and network protocols. The practical approach was very interesting as it offered valuable insights into the workings of the HTTP protocol, how to use Telnet to send HTTP requests, and how to install CGI applications on a web server. Studying PHP for web development, comprehending security issues, and using Wireshark for protocol analysis gave theoretical knowledge a useful practical component. Ajax and jQuery were introduced, and the usage of technologies like Curl for HTTP POST requests demonstrated the dynamic nature of online application development.</p>
